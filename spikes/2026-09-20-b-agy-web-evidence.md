# B: restore the authorized AGY investigation evidence procedure

## Basis and ownership

Remote `main` fetched on 2026-09-20: `2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622`.
Shared authoring basis: `1fb2de9e974e050804dcd4f3ec2adb629f83b6a9`.
B: `56f0f6657084f81516217ee51698f9b18cfc71dc`.
A (read-only): `92c8afd500499d8736afcc28b39a87a4f87fed50`.
The owner reaffirmed that yesterday's AGY page-fetch defect is delegated to B
for repair and testing. The clarification does not request an audit-redaction
change. This implements existing C29/R-INVEST, not a REVIEW web exception.

## Evidence and current behavior

The [original spike](2026-09-19-google-web-evidence.md) records search-only
answers, unfetched citations and one bounded before/after experiment showing
improvement with the shared clause. That experiment does not prove B behavior
or a general failure rate. B `bin/antigravity_wrapper.py:402-448` lacks `--web`
and the clause. Its dispatch at `:652-676` and custody call at `:704-711` use
the same local prompt. A already appends its clause after validation at
`3rd-Agent/wrappers/antigravity_wrapper.py:1381-1393`; its clause is at `:294`.

## B change and preserved functionality

- Add explicit `--web` for raw INVESTIGATION only; require `--sandbox read-only`.
- Reject blank caller prompts and formal/preflight combinations before provider
  work. Load the single fenced clause from a byte-identical vendored
  `prompts/investigation.md` only for the authorized operation; append one blank
  line and that clause without trimming caller bytes.
- Pin the vendored document and digest in a separate prompt provenance manifest;
  do not alter the independently pinned candidate schema bundle or revision adoption.
- Reuse existing command construction, guard, schema, audit and failure-log paths.
  They receive the final prompt. Hardened masking and failure-only run-log behavior
  remain unchanged. Do not claim that redacted success logs retain full prompt bytes.
- Preserve no-flag behavior, arbitrary optional schemas, read-only mutation denies,
  existing owner denies, auth, process cleanup and REVIEW no-web behavior.

No common normative clause or case expectation changes. D-B2's proposed new
custody destination is not implemented; complete C29 durable-custody conformance
is not claimed by this behavioral repair.

## Verification and Claude handoff

Before production edits: dedicated fresh Terra/high RED; then smallest fix and
separate fresh GREEN, full macOS/Ubuntu 24.04 regressions, packaged byte equality,
and required full-scope multi-family review. A live AGY 1.2.7 Pro/high investigation
will retain the sent prompt and raw stream in the explicitly scoped spike output.
The leader compares completed page-fetch events with every answer citation and
independently checks the cited source. Prompt instructions alone are not proof.

Claude leader: review this same shared commit and the subsequent B evidence.
Keep A unchanged while B leads. A's existing append is already present; compare
the live fetch/citation result and any new failure cause before applying changes.
Do not copy B's native plan-mode adapter into A's custom research-agent route.
The initial section records the plan before B changed its source. The following
observations are subsequent evidence, not whole-contract completion.

## Live paired result on AGY 1.2.7

One pair used the same 805-character caller prompt, Pro/high, existing native
plan/read-only route and timeout. The after arm added only `--web`; its sent
prompt was 1,667 characters (805 + two newlines + the exact 860-character shared
clause). Wrapper/provider exit status was zero for both. These are one-run
observations, not a reliability or comparative speed benchmark.

| Observation | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Elapsed seconds | 203.491 | 503.4 |
| Completed `search_web` events | 12 | 11 |
| Completed `read_url_content` events | 1 | 12 |
| Failed `read_url_content` events | 5 | 16 |
| Completed `view_file` events | 2 | 27 |

Before, the answer cited repository/site roots that had no matching page fetch
and guessed a policy priority. After, asserted web facts cited fetched tagged
source URLs; the answer explicitly left the policy and local-file questions
UNSURE. Completed tool events establish execution, not full page delivery or
correct interpretation. The local question lacked an absolute fixture path in
both prompts; guessed paths failed. That fixture limitation is separate from
the page-fetch behavior and proves no C28 or containment regression.

### Residual: delivered page artifacts can be incomplete

The leader inspected only the after run's generated page artifacts and compared
them with direct reads of the same official version-tagged URLs:

| Source | Direct source | AGY delivered body | Comparison |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`read-only.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/v0.60.0/packages/core/src/policy/policies/read-only.toml) | 2,246 bytes, 56 lines | 996 characters, 18 lines | Strict prefix; actual tool rule omitted |
| [`non-interactive.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/v0.60.0/packages/core/src/policy/policies/non-interactive.toml) | 158 bytes, 7 lines | 148 characters, 7 lines | Strict prefix; final `interactive = false` cut |

The first artifact ended inside a comment; the second ended at `interactiv`.
Both had a DONE page-fetch event. The model's truncation uncertainty is supported
by the actual artifact; a wrapper success must not be described as complete
research. Raw source SHA-256 values were respectively
`4899746262c3beedce94ca90fdcbb50028e52232747288e5bff73c523db05bfb` and
`721978c4f1153b7abb5ea24d647dd6acb7093b264ee8f5438b07ee014da369da`.

The [official tool reference](https://www.antigravity.google/docs/hooks) exposes
`read_url_content(Url)`; it does not supply a verified CLI pagination or
untruncated-fetch switch. No such switch or global settings change is invented.
Root cause inside the vendor fetch/render path remains unisolated. The current
repair fixes the omitted C29 invocation procedure; it does not fix this distinct
provider-content truncation. Keep it as a shared A/B investigation item, with
UNSURE on incomplete evidence. A's custom-agent route needs its own reproduction;
the native B result alone cannot establish identical A behavior.

Task-scoped raw diagnostics are retained locally for this requested spike only.
No new permanent evidence store is added; see the
[owner's D-B2 decision](../decisions/2026-09-20-owner-follow-up.md).
