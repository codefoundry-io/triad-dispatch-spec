# Codex-host B: current status and Claude handoff

## Current implementation status — 2026-09-20

This section supersedes the completion labels in the preserved release audit
below. It changes no normative rule, schema, prompt, policy payload or runtime
behavior. A remains read-only until the owner-designated B handoff point.

| Basis | Verified state |
|---|---|
| Published B implementation | `8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915`, feature branch `codex/agy-web-evidence`, open PR 37; P1, P2 and P4 completed |
| B documentation refresh | `3d62b7cc370d2c72fc439a431d5f78ab76875b98`, pushed on the same branch; only README/handoff/checklist files, no P3 source |
| B remote main | `56f0f6657084f81516217ee51698f9b18cfc71dc`; feature publication is not merge or installation |
| Local B P3 draft | `_common.py` packaged-loader change, untracked `bin/verdict_v2.py` and adapter tests; no operational v2 switch or final fresh GREEN |
| A inspected read-only | `92c8afd500499d8736afcc28b39a87a4f87fed50`; tracked source unchanged, unrelated untracked material preserved |
| Latest fetched shared main | `2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622` |
| Published authoring basis before this update | `11582b0f6fe6cc6bd292cbb90dfd07dab452ed75`; candidate branch, not shared main |
| Payload provenance | Schema bundle `055204c`; P4 policy/investigation amendment `6f0f274`; reading newer authoring history does not repin payload bytes |
| Adoption/release | Only `rev-0` exists in remote shared tags. No new adoption, merge, install or release is claimed; the prior 0.2.555 release receipt does not prove these feature-branch changes are installed. |

A fresh native source audit (`gpt-5.6-terra`, `high`, `fork_turns=none`, runtime
metadata UNEXPOSED) checked P3 wiring without edits, tests or providers. The
leader verified the findings and retained the existing condition-digest and
capture/verify baseline. This audit is not a new formal admission round.

### Current case register

| Cases | Implemented and previously verified | Remaining obligation |
|---|---|---|
| C1, C2, C6 | Reader/stdin/owned-group supervision, partial setup and guard-release custody; P1 adds catchable parent-signal reconciliation. `tests/test_terminal_transport.py`, `test_parent_signals.py`, `test_antigravity_stream_json.py`. | Retain final regressions; no SIGKILL/host-failure or every-provider guarantee. |
| C3–C5, C7 | Fresh-IPC age floor, proven allocation, verified export, inventory, resumable cleanup and idempotence. `tests/test_log_cleanup.py`, `test_review_cleanup_custody.py`. | Implemented for B-owned resources; retain these controls in P3. |
| C8 | Shared map membership and explicit alias/direct-exit exceptions; B `6653bdc`, `tests/test_exit_token_contract.py`. | Implemented; new map rows are not new emitted repair states. |
| C9, C10 | P1 common CLI transport in audit/failure IPC; actual stdin/route/binary/version, legacy attempt=1. [B producer](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/bin/_common.py#L325-L336); `test_common_transport_receipt.py`. | Native receipt production, per-entry review attempt progression and v2 collection. Capacity/schema-repair retries are not review attempts. |
| C11, C17 | Common injection scrub and Google route-specific scrub. `test_provider_wrappers.py`, `test_google_diagnostics.py`. | Preserve in P3; not live principal/authentication proof. |
| C12 | P2 defaults, `.agents/triad-review-legs.json` discovery, strict merge-by-name validation and enabled-roster display. [B resolver](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/bin/review_roster.py#L42-L89); `test_review_roster.py`. | Runtime prepare/dispatch does not consume it; `capabilities_checked` is false. |
| C13, C14, C30 | Canonical schemas, strict original JSON, six-binding offline validator and legacy isolation. [B validator](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/bin/validate_v2.py#L74-L99); `test_validate_v2.py`. | Shaped prompts, active producers and N-result admission must switch together. Local adapter remains a draft. |
| C15 | P4 exact separate B 999/998 profile with web denies; existing search/catch-all/Plan-transition protections retained. [B policy consumer](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/bin/gemini_wrapper.py#L73-L135); `test_investigation_completion.py`. | B1–B3 and A V1–V5 live checks NOT RUN; byte equality is not effective-policy proof. |
| C16, C18, C22 | Existing selected-binary version/help/preflight checks and P2 separate model/effort data. | Roster-to-native/CLI capability and argument mapping; legacy formal Gemini still uses Auto. Explicit v2 must request route-valid Pro/HIGH without changing authentication or inventing runtime identity. |
| C19 | Existing capacity/schema-repair retries and failed-round evidence retention. | Unchanged-basis failed-entry-only review retry, immutable attempt 2 and retained valid siblings. Valid negative verdicts are not transport retries. |
| C20 | Condition digest and capture/final fingerprint verification. [B capture/verify](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/bin/review_round.py#L1859-L1907). | Full v2 roster/condition binding and fenced prior findings/rebuttals delivered to every entry on changed-basis full review. |
| C21, C23 | Fixed-family legacy admission and paired Google custody. | N-entry aggregation, informational blockers, separate family coverage and exclusive per-name/attempt result/read-evidence custody. |
| C24 | P4 macOS 1,429 passed; Ubuntu 24.04 unprivileged run 1,427 passed + two existing filesystem skips. | Complete P3/final integrated verification; current runs do not certify drafts or the authenticated install/dispatch matrix. |
| C25 | P4 raw prompts/custom schemas/models plus authorized additional input roots; Gemini comma-path and unbound REVIEW expansion refusal. `test_investigation_completion.py:62`. | Preserve through P3; no mandatory investigation envelope or permanent web archive. |
| C26, C27 | Guarded link-text/no-follow evidence and frozen route/executable/version baseline. | Bind v2 entries to existing controls. Prepared-copy refusal/dormant hook remain; no OS-containment claim. |
| C28 | P4 entry-cwd-relative inputs, checks and masked summary/audit records. [B helpers](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/bin/_common.py#L499-L576); `test_wrapper_relative_paths.py`, `test_investigation_completion.py:21`. | Implemented; preserve the accepted diagnostic limitations below. |
| C29 | Both raw Google `--web` triggers append the shared clause last, including Gemini schema repair. [B tests](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/8f12bd58e401d061ba4a9bc889791e24718fb915/tests/test_investigation_completion.py#L97-L183). | URL-body prefix loss is a non-fatal known issue; affected evidence remains incomplete/UNSURE. No new failure, per-call reprobe or vendor-fix claim. |

### What remains to implement

1. Vendor the four published v2 review prompt files with provenance; connect v2
   renderer, wrapper producer and authoritative collector together, keeping
   explicit legacy and raw/custom-schema entry points.
2. Consume the P2 roster in preparation, validate route/model/effort before
   inference and print complete native/CLI invocations under existing auth guards.
3. Bind all six result axes to immutable per-entry/attempt result/read-evidence
   locations and collect actual native/CLI transport.
4. Aggregate all N entries including informational entries, independent family
   coverage, missing/invalid results, Minor-only selection deviations and
   same-family result/read-evidence swap rejection.
5. Retry only failed entries on an unchanged basis; retain siblings and attempts.
   Changed code/conditions require fresh full-scope review by all enabled entries
   with prior findings/rebuttals delivered as data.
6. Finish fresh RED/GREEN, platform regressions, new-file distribution coverage,
   plan review and final integrated review.

The local producer adapter has 33 focused leader-passing tests; it is not final
fresh GREEN or completed P3. The [Claude producer spike](../spikes/2026-09-20-b-cross-site-and-producer-spikes.md)
supports a bounded producer projection while full local validation stays strict.
That synthetic echo is not actual review/admission; the draft is not distribution-covered.

D-B1/D-B2/D-5 are **settled**, not outstanding owner choices: separate policies,
existing masking/failure-only logs without a new web store, and the selected B
roster path. Keep the legacy workspace four-leg development gate separate from
public v2 roster/retry semantics.

### Verification-only and publication work

- [B1–B3](../contracts/gemini-readonly-b.verify.toml) and
  [A V1–V5](../contracts/gemini-readonly.verify.toml): NOT RUN, service evidence
  gaps rather than missing policy files.
- AGY 1.2.7 legacy-search compatibility is unverified: release notes/init
  inventory differ and the requested grep was not actually called. Model prose
  is not a tool-failure result. Preserve routing; this is separate from the
  accepted URL-body known issue.
- P4 `triad-b-p4-r1`: four SAFE, ADMITTED_SAFE, digest
  `3b3f3414f05714417dd73d6d2ea600eabd19bfec12a06c305441e138fdcc3209`,
  integrity verified and exact temporary custody cleaned after export. Dedicated
  GREEN: 108 focused / 1,429 full macOS; Ubuntu 1,427 + two skips. These prior
  results were not rerun for this documentation-only refresh.
- Accepted P4 diagnostic limits: invalid extra-directory candidate may show
  entry cwd while the underlying error names the rejected path; missing required
  jsonschema during Gemini provenance parsing exits 1 instead of 3. Both refuse
  before inference and preserve masking.
- Final case/rule/unit reconciliation, integrated review, clean distribution,
  approved merge and explicit adoption/install/release remain. The proposed
  repository-wide spec/drift checker is separate authoring tooling, not missing
  current payload-hash validation or a new P3 requirement.

### Log and review-resource lifecycle

The normative source is [R-CLEANUP](../reference/review-rules.md#R-CLEANUP), with
the terminal flow in [process.md](../reference/process.md) and C3/C4/C5/C7.
It requires verified export before temporary review-root deletion, proven
ownership, preserved uncertain residue, idempotence and a fresh-IPC age floor
even under caps. It does not prescribe common numeric thresholds or automatic
expiry for all retained evidence.

The complete B operational table is [README log retention](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/3d62b7cc370d2c72fc439a431d5f78ab76875b98/README.md#log-retention-and-lifecycle).
Source at B `8f12bd5`: `_common.py:260–280,2305–2392,3003–3136`;
`review_round.py:1221–1353`. Existing log/cleanup tests cover these paths.
No new cleaner, logger, timer or deletion was introduced.

A's next-run floor is 7,200 seconds at [A common:3676](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad/blob/92c8afd500499d8736afcc28b39a87a4f87fed50/3rd-Agent/wrappers/_common.py#L3670-L3707);
B's is 3,600. That difference alone does not violate R-CLEANUP. A's cap loop at
[A common:3386–3395](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad/blob/92c8afd500499d8736afcc28b39a87a4f87fed50/3rd-Agent/wrappers/_common.py#L3386-L3409)
still unlinks old-sorted entries without an age-floor check. Carry forward C3's
existing fresh-sibling requirement when A resumes, preserving read-audit
primary/copy semantics rather than copying B's storage layout.

Debug files, durable exports, task `_runs` records and provider-owned AGY brain
data are not covered by next-run failure-IPC cleanup. The
[known-issue disposition](2026-09-20-owner-follow-up.md#ki-agy-url-body-prefix-non-fatal-known-issue)
adds no permanent log and does not authorize deleting collected evidence.

### Updated A follow-up for completed P4

| Topic | A source at `92c8afd` | Follow-up; A stays unchanged in this step |
|---|---|---|
| C15 policy | `3rd-Agent/wrappers/policies/gemini-readonly.toml`, separate 100/200 profile | Preserve A profile; do not copy B's 999/998 policy merely for symmetry. Both manifests remain unrun. |
| C25 extra roots | `3rd-Agent/wrappers/antigravity_wrapper.py:108–109,1216` uses cwd-derived review grants; A Gemini/Claude parsers have no extra-root option | Preserve review grants and add separately authorized raw roots when A adopts C25. |
| C28 | `_common.py:1148–1190` still rejects relative prompt/cwd; B now resolves and records masked paths | Apply captured entry-cwd semantics to A's wrappers, including its Codex subprocess, retaining checks/masking. |
| C29 | `antigravity_wrapper.py:1381–1393` already appends its clause; A Gemini has no explicit web trigger | Preserve AGY research-agent selection; add authorized Gemini trigger when adopting that path. No permanent web archive. |
| AGY search | `antigravity_wrapper.py:277–280,317–321` custom legacy tool list and init-inventory caveat | Do not infer live availability from init/model prose; do not silently alter the common prompt. |

The archived A source pairs below remain useful at `92c8afd`; their B completion
labels and D-B1/D-B2 pending claims are superseded above. Recheck each A source
before its implementation. Preserve native Claude, Codex subprocess, raw admit,
read-audit, worktree and auth guards. Read this published commit plus latest
shared main; report disagreements on the same basis under R-AUTHORING-SYNC.

# B 0.2.555: contract audit and Claude implementation handoff

Status: informational source audit, 2026-09-20. This document neither changes the
shared contract nor accepts a pending proposal. B's release is complete; adoption
and complete implementation of the shared agreement are not.

## Basis and meaning of the result

| Surface | Verified basis |
|---|---|
| B source / released main | `bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd`, public and locally installed `v0.2.555` |
| A source, read-only | `92c8afd500499d8736afcc28b39a87a4f87fed50`; A was not changed by B's work or this audit |
| Latest fetched shared remote main | `2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622` |
| Agreed normative basis | `bd506054e62b9b1ba5ef5e156ae8928ac414e4bf`; later main commits are acknowledgements / runner notes |
| Authoring branch inspected | `codex/host-b-preimplementation-audit`, pre-audit HEAD `10e4af0a2e38c65fc4bd0279eddf2205c6d2a52f` |
| Adoption | Only `rev-0` exists in the fetched shared tags. No `rev-1` adoption or B `SPEC_REVISION` is claimed. This branch is not shared main. |

The agreement explicitly distinguishes design agreement from executable
conformance ([decisions/rev-1-agreement.md:3–7](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-dispatch-spec/blob/2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622/decisions/rev-1-agreement.md#L3-L7)).
The owner subsequently authorized Codex-first implementation, integration and
deployment. Those instructions explain the B release; they do not imply that a
pending shared design was accepted or that unimplemented cases passed.

The earlier “five open findings” counts only reviewer-local IDs from the initial
25-finding diagnosis. It is **not** the count of all remaining contractual
obligations. C8, C18, C19, v2-dependent orchestration, adoption and verification
work remain in addition to D-B1/D-B2. No completion percentage is justified:
one case often contains several obligations and no complete common case runner
has produced a cross-host conformance result.

This audit used three independent fresh native Codex children (`gpt-5.6-terra`,
`high`, `fork_turns=none`) for transport/custody, Google/investigation, and A/B
comparison, followed by leader source adjudication. These are source audits,
**not** a new Claude/Google/Codex formal admission round. No provider or candidate
was run in this audit. Existing executed evidence is linked below.

## Complete case register

“Implemented locally” means the cited behavior is present with existing local
test evidence. It is not a declaration that every runtime/platform variant
passed. “Partial” names the retained obligation; “Open” is not an accepted host
exception. “Deferred” names an actual absent shared-v2 prerequisite.

| Case | Current B behavior / evidence | Assessment and remaining obligation |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Reader completion/error, stdin outcome, child exit and owned process-group reconciliation: [bin/_common.py:1303–1530](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L1303-L1530); [tests/test_terminal_transport.py:88–150](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/tests/test_terminal_transport.py#L88-L150). | Implemented locally for bounded terminal transport. Synthetic evidence does not certify every authenticated provider/platform combination. |
| C2 | Partial thread setup is inside cleanup protection: [bin/_common.py:1419–1475](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L1419-L1475); [tests/test_terminal_transport.py:162–200](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/tests/test_terminal_transport.py#L162-L200). | Implemented locally; setup exceptions cannot silently leave success. |
| C3 | Age floor plus still-matching leaf identity during pruning: [bin/_common.py:2871–2918](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L2871-L2918); [tests/test_log_cleanup.py:898–939](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/tests/test_log_cleanup.py#L898-L939). | Implemented locally; fresh siblings are not deleted just to reach a cap. |
| C4, C5, C7 | Proven allocation, verified export, inventory, allocation-bound resumable claim and revalidation before deletion: [bin/review_round.py:963–1005](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/review_round.py#L963-L1005), [bin/review_round.py:1141–1351](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/review_round.py#L1141-L1351); [tests/test_review_cleanup_custody.py:36–56](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/tests/test_review_cleanup_custody.py#L36-L56). | Implemented locally for B-owned disposable roots. Not a defense against malicious same-UID forgery or arbitrary open-FD concurrency. |
| C6 | Completed transcript survives settings-release failure, which cannot convert failure to success: [bin/antigravity_wrapper.py:666–697](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/antigravity_wrapper.py#L666-L697); [tests/test_antigravity_stream_json.py:1804](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/tests/test_antigravity_stream_json.py#L1804). | Implemented locally. Preserve the primary failure when one already exists. |
| C8 | Local token map: [bin/_common.py:69–88](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L69-L88); pre-spawn encode failure is `unknown` / exit 1 at [bin/_common.py:1329–1340](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L1329-L1340). | Open. No exhaustive shared emitted-token/direct-exit/alias membership test. The import assertion at [bin/_common.py:2303–2308](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L2303-L2308) cannot prove membership because the map has a non-null fallback. Shared phase exceptions and B migration delta remain at [contracts/exit-tokens.json:109–123](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-dispatch-spec/blob/2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622/contracts/exit-tokens.json#L109-L123). |
| C9, C10 | Host-local audit and run-log fields remain: [bin/_common.py:1972–2039](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L1972-L2039), [bin/_common.py:2747–2767](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L2747-L2767). | Deferred common receipt schema. `receipt-fields.json` does not yet exist; existing records are not an implementation of that missing common schema. |
| C11 | Common loader/interpreter scrub plus formal Google route-specific removal: [bin/_common.py:1208–1223](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/_common.py#L1208-L1223), [bin/gemini_wrapper.py:43–53](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/gemini_wrapper.py#L43-L53); [tests/test_provider_wrappers.py:1770–1840](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/tests/test_provider_wrappers.py#L1770-L1840). | Implemented local environment controls. This does not prove an empty environment or an authenticated account identity. |
| C12 | Fixed per-family render options: [bin/review_round.py:2272–2353](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/review_round.py#L2272-L2353). | Open / shared-v2 dependency. No general roster loader, named override/unknown-key validation or resolved N-leg dispatch matrix. A paired Pro/Flash fixture is not N-leg support. |
| C13 | Blocking findings and open questions prevent SAFE; Minor-only SAFE is valid. [bin/verdict_schema.py:147–161](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch/blob/bde3f77301af60c5d13d7fd14f2ed3ed1e8f26dd/bin/verdict_schema.py#L147-L161). | Partial. Minor-only non-affirmative verdicts are rejected, whereas the agreed mapping permits them with a recorded verdict-selection deviation. Common wire migration remains. |

Case inputs, expected results, rule anchors and summaries on the authoring branch
were compared with fetched main and are unchanged; only host test/status mappings
were updated earlier. This is evidence against silently weakening the cases,
not proof of their execution. Shared schema prerequisites are explicitly listed
at [contracts/README.md:7–12](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-dispatch-spec/blob/2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622/contracts/README.md#L7-L12).

## What changed in the implementation approach

| Area | Chosen B mechanism / preserved feature | Contract meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal supervision | Reused the existing supervisor; bounded reader/writer reconciliation and owned-group cleanup. Rejected an unbounded join or “stdout succeeded, ignore stderr” shortcut. | Internal correction toward C1/C2, not a new contract. |
| Cleanup | Allocation record, verified evidence export and resumable claim. Kept age floor and foreign-root refusal. | C4/C5/C7 implementation choice. No shared receipt schema was invented. |
| Review binding | Extended the existing digest with actual review conditions and toolkit bytes. Kept capture plus final fingerprint verification; did not add redundant render-time recapture. | C14/C20 local correction; no claim of complete v2 or prior-finding delivery. |
| C26 | Reused guarded worktree, TASK and renderer with visible link text; prepared copying still refuses unsafe links. | Host-local mechanism allowed by the agreement. Manual evidence and prompt-only controls are explicit limits. |
| AGY REVIEW web | Added `read_url(*)` to a **deny** list; omitted formal autoapproval while keeping raw investigation behavior. | “Drop read_url from builder” is misleading for B's deny-list builder. The implementation matches removal of web capability, not deletion of a deny. The existing [wording clarification](../spikes/2026-09-20-b-review-no-web.md#non-blocking-residuals-and-shared-wording-clarification) awaits shared reference correction. |
| Native/subprocess symmetry | Native Codex remains native; Claude remains subprocess. Dormant AGY hook was not activated. | Preserved host exception; no Codex exec leg added for visual symmetry. |
| Schema/adoption | Kept current v1 schema and host-local prompt implementation; did not manufacture rev-2 files or a `SPEC_REVISION`. | Transparent incompleteness, not completion by an alternative mechanism. |

The audit does not establish that every historical guard is necessary forever.
It establishes which current controls were preserved and which bounded fixes
have evidence. No claim of OS confinement follows from a prompt or digest.

## Actual design decisions still pending

1. **D-B1 — Gemini policy composition.** The current shared exact payload and B's
   canonical search/catch-all/Plan-transition controls are not identical.
   The [existing proposal](host-b-gemini-policy-composition-proposal.md) recommends
   an exact shared payload plus an enumerated B supplement; the alternative is
   one strengthened common file. Neither is implemented or accepted. B is not
   “stronger overall”: its current web allow is precisely the C15 gap.
   Combining the shared deny at 200 with B's unchanged allow at 999 would retain
   web access and is not a valid fix.
2. **D-B2 — exact evidence versus hardened audit masking.** The
   [existing proposal](host-b-evidence-custody-proposal.md) retains ordinary
   masking and uses an explicitly authorized private evidence destination for
   exact investigation bytes. Relative-path support must not require turning
   hardening off. This is proposed semantics, not a delivered C28/C29 fix.

These two decisions are not the whole backlog. C8 token alignment, C18 model
migration, C19 retry policy, the shared-v2 files and consumers, C20 residual
delivery, vendored prompt/contract adoption and live verification remain.
The desired behavior is already settled for many of them; they do not require
asking the owner again whether N legs, Pro/HIGH, full re-review after edits or
investigation web are wanted.

There is also an explicit operating-policy discrepancy: the shared
[reference/review-rules.md:163–172](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-dispatch-spec/blob/2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622/reference/review-rules.md#L163-L172) retires Flash as a reviewer, while the
owner-workspace formal exception used for this B release requires Pro and Flash
as separate Google legs. The release correctly reports all four participants;
that local exception is not evidence of shared roster parity and should not be
copied into A as a common default.

## Claude handoff: current source pairs, not a mechanical port

A's source paths are from its `codefoundry-io/triad` source repository, not the
flattened plugin export. Preserve A's own adapters and worktree lifecycle.
Each row names the current difference, the smallest investigation/correction,
and a feature that must survive. Reproduce before changing A.

B is a source of tested corrections, **not** a normative template for all A
behavior. In particular, do not copy B's current Gemini web allow, Auto routing,
relative-path refusal, incomplete common wire or all-leg retry rule as parity
requirements.

## Evidence, remaining verification and next implementation boundary

The [release record](../spikes/2026-09-20-b-release-0555.md) contains prior executed
suite, four-leg admission, archive/cache equality, installed lifecycle and
fresh-process discovery evidence. Its formal SAFE result applies to the reviewed
bounded B changes and existing release criteria; it does not close the entire
case table above.

No new test run or provider run occurred for this documentation audit.
V1–V5 remain NOT RUN; model-written claims cannot replace their required runtime
attribution. A new C15 composition candidate needs its own effective-policy tests,
not a reused single-file result. Both hosts still need the revision adoption
record, exact vendored bytes/digests and the checks for their claimed revision.
The proposed shared `spec-check` and digest checker are also explicitly not yet
implemented in [reference/spec-authoring.md:65–69](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-dispatch-spec/blob/2eb883fee59e66556ee7c7f87189b38231136622/reference/spec-authoring.md#L65-L69) at the remote-main basis.

Suggested continuation order, not authorization to bypass unresolved design:

1. Resolve D-B1/D-B2 at a shared commit; keep agreed outcomes unchanged.
2. Implement independent rev-1 gaps in bounded slices with existing gates:
   token mapping, Google Pro/HIGH dispatch, C28/C29 and residual-data delivery.
3. Produce the agreed rev-2 schemas, then migrate roster, wire, receipts,
   same-family identity and retry together with all prompt pins.
4. Reconcile the public retry/roster policy with the owner-workspace exception
   before claiming common behavior; retain current authority until then.
5. Run the applicable shared cases and platform/runtime checks, adopt the
   revision explicitly, and only then claim that revision's conformance.

### Message to Claude leader

Read this document at its published commit, fetch current shared main, and
record both SHAs. Review the source-paired handoff against your current A source
before modifying it. Confirm which findings reproduce, reject unsupported ones
with exact source evidence, and preserve the listed A-specific guards. Do not
treat B's release as whole-contract completion or D-B1/D-B2 as accepted decisions.
For a common design/contract/prompt change, record evidence/version, current and
proposed behavior, impact on both hosts, preserved features and verification in
the shared repository, and request review of that same commit. Keep the shared
expected outcomes intact; implementation and adoption remain distinct.
